Week 2 Challenge - Personal Portfolio HTML + CSS

*DISCLAIMER* 

I ran into a lot of issues (mostly with not having enough time due to an emergency at my day job) but I did the best I could in the time that I had.

I did not like the way the layout was heading after a couple of attempts and I wanted to fix it before the due date - You will see this within the PLETHORA of commits I did LOL.

I understand I will lose a lot of marks and I have every intention of continuing to work on the challenge to re-submit for better marks in the future.
